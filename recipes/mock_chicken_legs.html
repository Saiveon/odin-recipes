    <p>Perfectly seasonsed and crispy fried mock chicken legs; they are made with veal and pork then browned in a pan of oil.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground veal</li>
        <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crushed pineapple, well drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix veal, pork, pineapple, bell pepper, salt, and paprika together in a bowl until well combined. Form a portion of the mixture around a short wooden skewer into the shape of a chicken leg. Repeat with remaining meat.</li>
        <li>Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs and water together in another shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Roll skewers in bread crumbs, then dip into egg mixture. Roll again in bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded skewers, unstacked, onto a plate and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add skewers and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Add a little water and reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet tightly and cook until skewers are cooked through, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
